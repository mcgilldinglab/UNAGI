    "This tutorial offers a step-by-step guide on how to prepare your single-cell datasets for training and for subsequent analysis using the UNAGI tool. The UNAGI tool lies in the assumption that the dataset is a time-series single-cell data and time information of each cell is known. Thus, to use the UNAGI tool, it's mandatory to annotate the time-point information for each cell.\n",
